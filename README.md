# agi

This mobile application will include several capabilities of state of the art artificial intelligence and so I have dubbed the project (rather brazenly) AGI or Artificial General Intelligence.
I aim to implement several AI tasks in the app in the following tasks:

- Vision
- Speech
- Reinforcement learning

I intend to do this by consuming readily available APIs (some of which are free) as well as APIs I develop myself.

By so doing, I intend to develop open source applications embedded with artificial intelligence and show how this can be done with Flutter.

I am convinced that solving a singular task cannot lead us to develop systems with artificial general intelligence. I am persuaded that we will only have a shot at it if we combine these algorithms to complement one another seamlessly, much like a complex living organism. These little projects are my baby steps in the pursuit of such endeavors.
